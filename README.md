## :page_with_curl: About

React project developed by [Pedro Costa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrohrcosta/) at the end of Unit 12 Front-end Development Module of Trybe's Web Development course. I was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

We had to develop a _iTunes_-style React application using the React Router library and fetching music data from the Apple Music's API.

### Note

This project is still under development. I am implementing the layout, and I will refactor the code. I haven't deployed the application yet.
